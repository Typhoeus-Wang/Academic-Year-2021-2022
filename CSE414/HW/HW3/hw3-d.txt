My overall experience of using Microsoft Azure is not bad. It is powerful tool to create database and maintain it
and we could easily access to the data which means we do not need to store data locally.
However, the speed is a little slow compared with sqlite3 I used on mac and the process of
importing data is kind of complicated.
