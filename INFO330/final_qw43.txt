I attest that I did not communicate with anyone other than the instructors about the questions
on this final, and that all of the work is my own. Qirui Wang

Join Algorithm 3 is called “Hash Join”
Join Algorithm 2 is called “Merge Join”
Join Algorithm 1 is called “Nested Loops Join”

4cii
The cost of Join Algorithm 3 could be estimated as |A| + |B|
The cost of Join Algorithm 1 could be estimated as |A| * |B|
The cost of Join Algorithm 2 could be estimated as log(|A|) + log(|B|) + max(|A|, |B|)

4ciii 
Join Algorithm 1 is typically used when both A and B are small
Join Algorithm 3 is typically used when A or B is large, but not both; it is very common in practice
Join Algorithm 2 is typically used when both A and B are large, or when tables can be accessed in sorted order
